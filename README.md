# Version Control, Checkpoints for Software
Imagine you're working on a big software project with a team of people. Version control is a super-smart system that keeps track of every change made to the code. It's like a detailed history for your project.

Whenever someone makes a change, like adding a new feature or fixing a bug, version control records it. This way, if things don't go as planned or someone wants to go back to an earlier, working version, they can do it easily. It's basically a safety net for your code. Think Checkpoints in Video Games

It also allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without stepping on each other's toes. Version control helps teams collaborate effectively and makes sure that everyone's contributions are organized and can be managed smoothly.
